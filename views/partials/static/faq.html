                                <p class="col-xs-5">When selecting an agent, the best source may be your family and friends.
                                Many may have sold a property in the past and can refer you to an agent they found to be capable.
                                Selling a home is a complex transaction, so experience should be a consideration.
                                Also consider agents who work for larger companies, as they tend to offer more extensive training.

                                <strong class="col-xs-5">How do I negotiate?</strong>
                                <p class="col-xs-5">Pricing your property with a 'cushion' for negotiation can be costly if it pushes the price above the fair market value range.
                                    To begin the negotiating process, you need interested Buyers.
                                    If overpriced, the number of Buyers that see the property is reduced, so the likelihood of an acceptable offer is also reduced.
                                    The best approach is to price a home just within the market value range.
                                    This allows room for negotiations, without sacrificing exposure.

                                <strong class="col-xs-5">What are the dangers if I overprice?</strong>
                                <p class="col-xs-5">When a property is overpriced, windows of opportunity are missed.
                                    Broker and buyer interest is at its highest when a property is initially placed on the market.
                                    But if the property is priced above realistic market value, the excitement and number of showings are greatly reduced.
                                    Later, it may be necessary to adjust the price below market value to compete with new, competitively priced listings.
